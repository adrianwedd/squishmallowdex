2. Unzip it
3. Open the `squishmallowdex` folder
4. Right-click **`setup.sh`** and choose **Open With -> Terminal**
5. A small window will open and install everything
6. When it says setup is complete, you are done

If your computer asks, choose **Open** or **Run**.

## Windows (Friendly Steps)

1. Install Python:
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click the big **Download Python** button
   - Run the installer
   - Check the box that says **Add Python to PATH**

2. Open the `squishmallowdex` folder
3. Double-click **`setup.bat`**

If `setup.bat` opens as text instead of running, do not panic.
Just close it and ask a helper to run the setup once for you.

## After Setup

You will have:

- `squishmallowdex.html` - your collection page
- `squishmallowdex.csv` - a spreadsheet copy

Open the HTML file anytime to browse your collection.
